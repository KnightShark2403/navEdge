This project aims to build a smart, cost-efficient ETA prediction system for daily commutes (Home to Office & back) using simulated travel data, open-source routing APIs like OpenRouteService (ORS), HERE, TOMTOM and machine learning models. By generating synthetic data for 50 users over 3 months and factoring in realistic traffic patterns based on time and day, the system predicts travel time with high accuracyâ€”without relying on Google Maps. With features like distance, time of day, and traffic multipliers, models like Random Forest or XGBoost can be trained and deployed via a simple Flask or Streamlit app, offering scalable and budget-friendly real-world applicability.
